## A Summary of Han Frauenfelder's Work in Biological Physics

From initial Mössbauer experiments to his final work on dielectric relaxation,
Hans led high-level collaborations for some 42 years. Even though scientists
start later than musici ans do, that'ss the career of JS Bach or the band Kiss
in length, if not in impact. Here's a quick look at the collaborative
style, scientific approach, protein molecules, and results that Hans achieved
in that period, together with a nod to why the work is important. 

### Collaborators, Gunny, and Interdisciplinary Work

Biological physics is a collaborative process, so when I write "Hans" here, I
mean a loose collection of students, long-term and one-time collaborators,
friendly and unfriendly competit ors, and people he inspired to work on protein
dynamics (often without contact first).Hans had collaborators who became
distinguished during the collaboration--Peter Wolynes, Greg Petsko, and Steve
Sligar come to mind--but Hans' approach to interdisciplinary work arose out of
interactions with a biochemist who was already science-famous, I.C.  Gunsalus.
Gunny was a force of nature, connecting everything in seemingly all directions.

On the phone, Gunny spoke like he was paying by the millisecond. His phone
style , unique in those pre-caller-ID days, didn't include his name or a
closing, ju st a stream of rapid-fire information. Unless warned, you were
lucky if could ID him before your first call ended. By contrast, Gunny in
person was generous, ha ppy to admit even a lowly graduate student to his club
of acquaintances. That cl ub had amazing privileges, far-flung members. Gunny
was on Jim Watson's thesis committee; he once hand-delivered a petition to LBJ;
he was friends with Pavarotti's accompanist. 

Communication in an interdisciplinary team starts by learning to speak each
other's language, otherwise team members shut down when confronted with ideas
and technical terms they haven't encountered before. Hans and Gunny together
put enormous effort into cross-team clarity. In their weekly joint group
meeting, no question was too stupid. Meetings paused until everyone, including
the newest st udents, agreed that answers made sense.


### P-450 and Myoglobin

Gunny's favorite protein was cytochrome P-450, which he discovered by dumping
"interesting" chemicals down a dirty sink for weeks, then culturing the bact
eria that grew there. P-450 turned out to be the molecular buzz-saw that cuts
up "foreign" chemicals in the human body.  P-450 is a complex enzyme, with 9
steps in its reaction cycle (including a change in oxidation state of the iron
at om). It's also hard work to purify, starting with feeding camphor to
a 200-liter fermenter through an open port that releases gases redolent of
sewage. Turning physicists loose on P-450 cause alarming amounts of precious
protein to be con sumed before a single experiment was complete. Gunny
suggested using myoglobin, a protein that stores oxygen in muscles and the red
thing in red meat, "for a few weeks while you get your experiment
working."

Hans wasn't the first to find myoglobin a congenial protein to work with. Myog
lobin from sperm whales forms big, beautiful crystals, and that had caught the a
ttention of John Kendrew back in 1952 when he and Max Perutz were working toward
s the first crystal structure of a protein. When they finally obtained the struc
ture of myoglobin, it was both exciting and ugly. Where the structure of DNA was
 like a cathedral window, myoglobin resembled entrails left behind by a dog.

### A Physicist's Approach

Understanding motions in myoglobin proved to be Hans' life work, and he threw
at it every technique and condition he could muster, eventually calling it "the
H-atom of biology". Hans approached myoglobin like the physicist that he
was--diving deep under every possible condition: temperature, pressure, pH,
salt concentration, and hydration. He built instruments, collected data, then
coughed up concepts and mathematical models to describe the data. The formulae
were par t and parcel of the results, but they didn't make communication with
biologist s any easier. It might have he`lped if we had anchored the biological
end of the work with phylogenetics, but that had to be left for much later (and
others).

### Five Results of Hans' Work

This effort was distributed among a community of hundreds of people, not all of
whom were directed by Hans. What is known is known mostly from myoglobin, but
co nfirmed on other proteins.

1. **Proteins fluctuate among a network of conformations.** Myoglobin has >50
   ac cessible conformations, with millisecond lifetimes.  The network appears
   hierarc hical when viewed through function because changes closer to the
   active site hav e greater functional effects.

 2. **Conformations are determined by interactions with the surrounding layer
    of waters and protons.** Some conformations are pH- and pressure-dependent;
    these arise from doubly-protonated residues which blow open the protein
    structure;

3. **Normal protein function sets off violent "proteinquakes".** The energy
   released in breaking a covalent bond is much greater than the free energy
   stabil izing protein structure. Function thus blows the protein apart for a
   tiny amount of time.

4. **Motions in proteins are classified as either transitions in the
   conformatio nal network or slaved to the solvent.** Conformational changes
   like aggregation are same in every protein. Slaved motions are large-scale
   like those of unfoldin g, and stop when the solvent freezes.

5. **Ligands move through proteins making use of hydrophobic pockets.** These
   pockets are the same ones where atoms of xenon bind specifically and can be
   found in every protein.  They are generally distinct from the binding pocket
   at the ac tive site.

### Why This Work Matters

Though I have worked in this area for a long time, long-term impacts (including 
applications) are the most difficult thing to predict, so I don't expect to ge
t them all right. There are also unpublished results that I'm not at liberty t
o discuss.

- **Structure prediction:** The structure prediction method AlphaFold from Deep
  Mind is currently making a big splash, the place where AI has firmly landed
  in s cience. There is general hope (with several startups based on that hope)
  that AI methods can predict structure with sufficient accuracy for drug
  discovery. But discordance among conformations is a major limitation of
  structure prediction me thods. If a structure-prediction method simply
  ingests the entire Protein Data B ank without distinguishing among the
  multiple conformations that exist in it, th e resulting method will predict
  structures that reflect some kind of average ove r all the conformations.
  Averaged conformations are generally much too inaccurat e to be used to
  virtually scan for small-molecule "hits" to proteins. Hans's work showed that
  networks of conformation are finite and classifiable, pointin g a way forward
  towards finding useful lead compounds in drug discovery.

- **Storing biologics:** Half a trillion dollars worth of protein drugs are
  sold every year. The years that an individual can use them is limited by
  immune resp onses triggered by aggregation, some of which happens in storage
  at -80 Â°C. Dis tinguishing from unfolding is valuable.

- **Fixing crystal structures and molecular dynamics:&& Surface tension is a
  powerful force not accounted for in the force fields calculated from bulk
  neutron scattering on water, on which both structure refinement and MD rely.
  Hans results point toward getting these interactions right.

- **Understanding:** There are fundamental forces of biology that govern
  structu re at levels from protein conformation upwards to protein assemblies,
  tissues, a nd organs. These forces involve water, protons, and their
  interactions with prot ein surfaces.

We can only do so much. I believe our efforts are models and examples, not just 
means to an end. There are more questions to be pursued, understanding to be gai
ned, and applications to be developed. However, science is a pyramid scheme, and
 Hans' students had to move on.
